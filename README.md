## How does it work? (Prolog)
>To use the expert system, you can query ```mental_health_diagnosis``` in the Prolog interpreter. The system will prompt the user with questions about symptoms and then provide a possible diagnosis based on the input provided.

## How does it work? (Python )
>To use the expert system, you can call the ```diagnostico_main()``` function in the Python interpreter. The system will prompt the user to enter the symptoms they are experiencing, and then a diagnosis will be made using inference rules. If not all symptoms are entered, the system will make a diagnosis using the pre-established probabilities in the Markov networks.
